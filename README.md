# EffectSwap2
A Minecraft plugin that got out of hand

Follow KodySimpson's tutorial on hot to set it up here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dem7dujCDvg
then download/clone my repo and build the plugin if you want. make sure there's no errors on the POM.xml.

This is built with maven, idk if it works with gradle

I won't have a link to download the plugin.
